# Random Ant Walk 🐜

A Python project that simulates and visualizes random 2D walks using `matplotlib`.  
Think of it like watching an "ant" wander around randomly — step by step.

---

## ✨ Features
- Generates random x and y steps.
- Interactive: choose how many steps the "ant" takes.
- Visualizes the walk with scatter plots.
- Option to generate multiple walks in one session.

---

## 📦 Installation
Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-ant-walk.git
cd random-ant-walk
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage
Run the visualization script:

```bash
python plot_walk.py
```

- You’ll be prompted for the number of steps.  
- A random walk will be plotted in a pop-up window.  
- After each walk, you can choose to generate another one.
